            <h2>Visitor Tips</h2>
            <p>We recommend arriving early in the day when animals are most active, especially during warmer months. Many of our species are more energetic in the morning hours before the heat of the day sets in. Comfortable walking shoes are essential, as our zoo covers extensive grounds with varied terrain including hills and natural pathways.</p>
            
            <p>Don't forget to bring sunscreen, hats, and water bottles, especially during summer visits. While we have water fountains throughout the zoo, staying hydrated is important for enjoying your full day. We also have several dining options ranging from quick snacks to full meals, but you're welcome to bring your own food and use our designated picnic areas.</p>

            <p>To enhance your experience, we offer audio guides available at the entrance, as well as a mobile app that provides interactive maps, animal information, and real-time updates about feeding times and special presentations. Our staff members stationed throughout the zoo are always happy to answer questions and provide recommendations based on your interests and the time you have available.</p>
