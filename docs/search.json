They are supposed to be quite good, especially at detecting when something is written 100% by AI or human. It urges the question of which side is at fault, has AI writing just advanced so much or is AI detecting simply not a very strong technology at the current moment. I have unfortunately missed the true goal of the data set but my initial interest was focused on the true capabilities of this AI detection and in my additional graphs I would focus more on the native/non-native piece of this data.\nThis information comes from the Tidy Tuesday of July 18th 2023: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2023/2023-07-18\nThis dataset, created by Weixin Liang, Mert Yuksekgonul, Yining Mao, Eric Wu, and James Zou, was designed to address their hypothesis that GPT detectors exhibit bias against non-native English writers. The authors aim to investigate the fairness and effectiveness of widely-used GPT detectors in distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written content. With the growing reliance on generative language models, the researchers recognize the potential for misuse and are concerned about the impact on non-native English speakers. Through evaluating GPT detectors using writing samples from both native and non-native English writers, they discovered a pattern of misclassification, where non-native English samples were often incorrectly flagged as AI-generated, while native samples were accurately identified. The study also found that simple prompting strategies could reduce this bias and bypass detectors, further highlighting the unintentional penalization of writers with limited linguistic resources. Their findings emphasize the ethical considerations of using such detectors, particularly in evaluative or educational contexts, and raise awareness about the potential exclusion of non-native English speakers from global conversations. https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02819"

Interestingly these outliers tend to be from the USA although there is a bias as there are overall more USA data points than either of the other countries. Other trends that are noticeable are females tend to be lighter and shorter although there is one outlier male that may be the lightest of all the data points. Additionally, china has a larger proportion of of data points that are taller than the rest which was surprising to me as I expected that to not be the case. And of course the Americans take the trophy for heaviest people, furthering the stereotype that Americans are fat even though obviously these are elite athletes.\nThis comes from the tidy tuesday of August the 6th in 2024: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-08-06/readme.md This data specifically comes from RGriffin, it offers a comprehensive historical record of the modern Olympic Games, covering every event from the first Games in Athens in 1896 up to the Rio Games in 2016. The data was collected by the author through web scraping of www.sports-reference.com in May 2018. The R code used for both scraping and cleaning the data is available on GitHub.
