They are supposed to be quite good, especially at detecting when something is written 100% by AI or human. It urges the question of which side is at fault, has AI writing just advanced so much or is AI detecting simply not a very strong technology at the current moment. I have unfortunately missed the true goal of the data set but my initial interest was focused on the true capabilities of this AI detection and in my additional graphs I would focus more on the native/non-native piece of this data.\nThis information comes from the Tidy Tuesday of July 18th 2023: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2023/2023-07-18\nThis dataset, created by Weixin Liang, Mert Yuksekgonul, Yining Mao, Eric Wu, and James Zou, was designed to address their hypothesis that GPT detectors exhibit bias against non-native English writers. The authors aim to investigate the fairness and effectiveness of widely-used GPT detectors in distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written content. With the growing reliance on generative language models, the researchers recognize the potential for misuse and are concerned about the impact on non-native English speakers. Through evaluating GPT detectors using writing samples from both native and non-native English writers, they discovered a pattern of misclassification, where non-native English samples were often incorrectly flagged as AI-generated, while native samples were accurately identified. The study also found that simple prompting strategies could reduce this bias and bypass detectors, further highlighting the unintentional penalization of writers with limited linguistic resources. Their findings emphasize the ethical considerations of using such detectors, particularly in evaluative or educational contexts, and raise awareness about the potential exclusion of non-native English speakers from global conversations. https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02819"

Interestingly these outliers tend to be from the USA although there is a bias as there are overall more USA data points than either of the other countries. Other trends that are noticeable are females tend to be lighter and shorter although there is one outlier male that may be the lightest of all the data points. Additionally, china has a larger proportion of of data points that are taller than the rest which was surprising to me as I expected that to not be the case. And of course the Americans take the trophy for heaviest people, furthering the stereotype that Americans are fat even though obviously these are elite athletes.\nThis comes from the tidy tuesday of August the 6th in 2024: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-08-06/readme.md This data specifically comes from RGriffin, it offers a comprehensive historical record of the modern Olympic Games, covering every event from the first Games in Athens in 1896 up to the Rio Games in 2016.

This graph is not especially helpful as the most used words are not very descriptive of what is going on in the tweets. What we can learn is that many of his tweets are about current news as he utilizes “today” heavily and they tend to be directed to a specific audience. By utilizing “we” and “our” it illustrates that Obama is not just sharing opinions but directing messages to the general public. I do not have a clear explanation why Obama and president are utilized so heavily although I assume that Obama tended to share quotes from himself or articles written which therefore would cite him.\n\n\nCode\npolicy_keywords &lt;- c(\"healthcare\", \"education\", \"climate\", \"economy\", \n                     \"jobs\", \"tax\", \"immigration\", \"gun\", \"poverty\")\n\n\nobama &lt;- obamaa |&gt;\n  mutate(text = str_to_lower(text),  # stringr\n         text = str_replace_all(text, \"[[:punct:]]\", \" \"))  #stringr\n\n# regular expressions\nadd_word_boundaries &lt;- function(word) {\n  paste0(\"(?&lt;!\\\\w)\", word, \"(?!\\\\w)\")  #look behind lookaround\n}\n\n\npolicy_regexes &lt;- setNames(map(policy_keywords, add_word_boundaries), policy_keywords)\n\n\npolicy_counts &lt;- map_dfr(names(policy_regexes), ~{\n  keyword_regex &lt;- policy_regexes[[.x]]\n\n\n  obama |&gt;\n    mutate(has_word = str_detect(text, regex(keyword_regex))) |&gt;\n    summarize(policy = .x,\n              count = sum(has_word))  \n}) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(count))\n\n\nprint(policy_counts)\n\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 2\n  policy      count\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 jobs          953\n2 economy       661\n3 tax           420\n4 education     399\n5 climate       318\n6 gun           272\n7 immigration   226\n8 poverty       144\n9 healthcare     46\n\n\nThe number of times each of the following words is found exactly like this in unique tweets. Eliminates taxpayers and other additions to the words. I decided to create this plot because it highlighted which political themes he addressed most heavily in his tweets and is much more useful than the earlier utilized graph. The top three results are heavily tied together so I am not surprised to see them at the top as I am sure they would all appear together in each unique tweet.\n\n\nCode\nobamatime &lt;- obamaa |&gt;\n  # Split the timestamp into date, time, timezone\n  separate(timestamp, into = c(\"date\", \"time\", \"timezone\"), sep = \"\\\\s+\") |&gt;\n  \n  mutate(time = str_replace_all(time, \"[^0-9:]\", \"\")) |&gt;  \n  \n  # Parse time into an HMS object and create hour and time_chunk columns\n  mutate(tlsime = hms(time),  \n         hour_of_day = hour(tlsime),  \n         time_chunk = cut(hour_of_day, breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 4), \n                          labels = c(\"00:00-03:59\", \"04:00-07:59\", \"08:00-11:59\", \n                                     \"12:00-15:59\", \"16:00-19:59\", \"20:00-23:59\"), \n                          include.lowest = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(time_chunk = factor(time_chunk, levels = c(\"00:00-03:59\", \"04:00-07:59\", \"08:00-11:59\", \n                                                    \"12:00-15:59\", \"16:00-19:59\", \"20:00-23:59\"))) |&gt;  \n  arrange(time_chunk) \n\n# Now count the tweets by time of day\ntweetsbytime &lt;- obamatime |&gt;\n  count(time_chunk)  \n\n\ntweetsbytime |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = time_chunk, y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n\n  labs(title = \"Obama Tweets by Time of Day (4-hour Chunks)\",\n       x = \"Time of Day (4-hour intervals)\",\n       y = \"Number of Tweets\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI then began to work with the timestamp column of the table, first searching for any trends within the time of day in which he would post. I assumed late afternoon as he finished up the structured work day and moved into the later hours of the day in which he may have more freedom to catch up on twitter. This in turn would increase the likelihood that he would see something to repost or share thoughts on issues he had worked with that day. This hypothesis was shown to be correct although I was surprised to see a much larger portion of late night tweets than mid-late morning tweets.\n\n\nCode\nobamatime &lt;- obamatime |&gt;\n  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) \n\n\ntweetsbymonth &lt;- obamatime |&gt;\n  mutate(month_year = format(date, \"%Y-%m\")) |&gt;  \n  count(month_year)  \n\n\ntweetsbymonth |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = month_year, y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Obama Tweets by Month Over His Whole Presidency\",\n       x = \"Month-Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Tweets\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was then interested if there were specific times of the year which brought upon extra tweeting from Obama but accidentally did not group by month so I had this messy graph. I was going to delete it but I found this trend quite interesting that the longer he was in office the more tweets he was sending out so I left this even though the x-axis is unclear. That jumble of numbers is the year followed by the month. For example 2012-02.\n\n\nCode\ntweetsbymonth &lt;- obamatime |&gt;\n  mutate(month = format(date, \"%m\")) |&gt;\n  count(month)  \n\n\ntweetsbymonth |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Obama Tweets by Month\",\n       x = \"Month\",\n       y = \"Number of Tweets\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"01\" = \"January\", \"02\" = \"February\", \"03\" = \"March\", \n                              \"04\" = \"April\", \"05\" = \"May\", \"06\" = \"June\",\n                              \"07\" = \"July\", \"08\" = \"August\", \"09\" = \"September\", \n                              \"10\" = \"October\", \"11\" = \"November\", \"12\" = \"December\")) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the graph I was actually hoping to create earlier and found that it is much less helpful in showing any real trends. I found it interesting that January had the most tweets and maybe that was due to issuing plans or goals for the new year or possibly sharing information and reports about the inauguration. But what did surprise was that it looked like a ton of tweets were being sent by him so that led me to the following calculation just out of interest.\n\n\nCode\ntotal_tweets &lt;- nrow(obamatime)\n\ntotal_days &lt;- n_distinct(obamatime$date)\n\naverage_tweets_per_day &lt;- total_tweets / total_days\n\n\naverage_tweets_per_day\n\n\n[1] 10.67786\n\n\nThis function found that Obama averaged 10.68 tweets per day which seems pretty ridiculous to me although I do understand that often he was just reposting something that had been created by others. I also understand this is supposed to be an informal type of sharing information so these may be quick thoughts that he quickly types up and sends out. Lastly, it would not be surprising if there are other individuals who post for him so many of the tweets may not be manually handed by Obama."
