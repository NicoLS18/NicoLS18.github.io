Hello! My name is Nicolas Laub-Sabater and I am an economics and environmental science double major at Pomona College. I enjoy fishing, competing in sports like golf, and generally spending time outdoors. I am also Puerto Rican, which has given me the opportunity to be bilingual, and I continue to cherish this gift—I’m especially excited to improve my Spanish when I study abroad in Spain next semester! Professionally, I’m interested in a career in consulting, where I can apply both analytical and strategic thinking to help organizations solve complex problems. This summer, I will be interning with Harbinger Motors as a logistics intern, where I’ll be focusing on supply chain operations, inventory management, and broader operational efficiency. I’m looking forward to gaining hands-on experience and applying what I’ve learned in the classroom.
