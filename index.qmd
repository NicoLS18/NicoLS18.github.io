Hello! My name is Nicolas Laub-Sabater and I am an economics and environmental science double major at Pomona College. I enjoy fishing, competing in different sports such as golf and in general just spending time outside. I am also Puerto Rican which has given me the opportunity to be bilingual and I have continued to cherish this gift and hope to improve it when I go abroad to Spain next semester!
