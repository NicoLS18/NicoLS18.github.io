            <p>Wildwood Zoo is proud to be home to an incredible diversity of animal species. Our collection includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish from ecosystems around the world. Each animal in our care receives expert veterinary attention, specialized diets, and enrichment activities designed to promote natural behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Featured Animals</h2>
            <p>Our animal collection represents years of careful planning and dedication to conservation. We participate in numerous Species Survival Plans (SSPs), collaborative breeding programs designed to maintain genetic diversity among threatened and endangered species. Many of our animals serve as ambassadors for their wild counterparts, helping visitors understand the challenges these species face in nature.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout the zoo, you'll encounter animals from every corner of the globe. Our Asian elephant herd demonstrates complex social behaviors, while our great ape exhibits showcase the intelligence and family bonds of our closest relatives. The reptile house features everything from tiny poison dart frogs to massive reticulated pythons, and our aviary brings you face-to-face with colorful macaws and toucans.</p>

            <p>We encourage all visitors to attend our daily keeper talks and feeding demonstrations. These programs provide fascinating insights into animal behavior, conservation status, and what we can all do to help protect wildlife. Our knowledgeable staff members are always happy to answer questions and share their passion for the animals in their care.</p>
